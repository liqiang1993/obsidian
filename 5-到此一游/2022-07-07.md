## 值得记录的事情
1.整体学习了markdown，消除了陌生感；
2.尝试在本地调试服务，之前没这样玩过，以后要经常玩；


## 值得坚持的方面
1.早起；


## 需要改进的方面
1.晚上吃饭的问题需要解决，不能每次都晚上吃，在给出具体的计划前，晚上不吃了，下午可以吃水果或蔬菜饼干;
2.技术不成体系，实践少，遗忘的速度很快。要通过输出促进体系形成，输出倒逼输入；


## 一点感想
计算机技术作为一个技能，需要勤加练习，不能只是看，这样技术水平不但无法提升，甚至会逐步下滑，能力要跟着年龄同步成长，加油吧，多多练习起来；



## things worth recording
1.learn the use of markdown,get familiar with it;
2.try to debug service locally, never played like this before, will play more often;

  
## aspects worth persevering
1.wake up early


## areas for improvement
1.  The problem of eating at night needs to be solved. You can't eat it every time. Before giving a specific plan, you don't eat at night. You can eat fruit or vegetable biscuits in the afternoon.
2.The technology is not systematic, the practice is little, and the speed of forgetting is very fast. It is necessary to promote the formation of the system through the output, and the output forces the input;


## a little impression
As a skill, computer technology requires diligent practice, not just watching. In this way, the technical level will not only fail to improve, but will even gradually decline. The ability must grow with age. Come on, practice more;
